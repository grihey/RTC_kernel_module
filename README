REVIEW
This is a demo kernel module which demontrates my skills  in creating KLM.
Module intented to emulating rtc device. Time represent in epoch unix
seconds.

Parameters of module is:
@param epoch_time_sec - unix seconds, initializing when module loaded by
                        current kernel time.
@param epoch_time_usec- useconds from timeval struct.
@param speed          - speed of time flow in module. Values of speed begins 
                        at 100, it means 100 - normal flow, like system 
                        clock, if speed greater - time flow in that module
                        accelerated, if lesser slowing down.
@param random         - if non-zero, current time ascending by increment
                        makes from @random-bound param, interprets like  
                        range of possible values of speed.
@param random-bound   - range of possible values of speed in random time mode

All parameter allows to read and write from sysfs to everyone.
(/sys/modules/rtc_romanov/parameters/{param-name})

Module could be inserted and removed from kernel space dinamically. 

TODO: * add device in /dev/ directory with standart interface.
      * add statistic file in /proc (What is statistic, uptime? whatelse?)
      * create testing shell scritp for module with behaviour setup.
